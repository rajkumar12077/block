# Cold Storage Temperature Display Fix

## Summary of Changes

The cold storage dashboard has been updated to properly display temperature data from the MongoDB tempdata collection. Here's what was fixed:

1. **Table Display Enhancement:**
   - Updated the Temperature Details column to show temperature, humidity, date and time
   - Added Device column to show the device name (e.g., "esp1")
   - Added Location column to show coordinates (latitude, longitude)

2. **Temperature Data Fetching Logic:**
   - Enhanced the logic to prioritize fetching data with the name "cold" as seen in the MongoDB collection
   - Improved the matching algorithm to find temperature data even when not directly linked to an order
   - Added fallbacks to ensure temperature data appears even with different data structures

3. **Display Format Improvements:**
   - Temperature is color-coded (red for high temperatures, green for optimal cold storage temperatures)
   - Date and time are properly formatted from either date/time fields or timestamp
   - Coordinates are displayed in a clean, readable format

## How It Works

1. The system attempts to fetch temperature data using:
   - The cold storage name from order data
   - The default value "cold" (as seen in the MongoDB document)
   - The user's name from localStorage

2. When displaying temperature data in the table:
   - First looks for an exact match with the order ID
   - Falls back to any temperature data with matching cold storage name
   - Displays "N/A" only if no relevant data is found

3. All relevant fields from the MongoDB document are now displayed:
   - Temperature
   - Humidity
   - Date
   - Time
   - Device name
   - Latitude
   - Longitude

The fix ensures that as long as there is temperature data in the MongoDB collection with the name "cold" (or matching the cold storage name), it will be displayed properly in the dashboard.

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding automated tests for temperature data fetching
2. Monitor error logs to ensure the fix is working as expected in production
3. Consider adding refresh functionality to periodically update temperature data without page reload
