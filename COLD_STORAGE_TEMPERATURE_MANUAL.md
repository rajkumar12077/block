# Cold Storage Temperature Data Fix

## Overview
This fix addresses the issue where temperature data wasn't being fetched correctly for the cold storage dashboard. The problem was that the code was looking for temperature data records with the field `coldStorageName`, but the actual MongoDB collection uses a simple `name` field.

## Changes Made

1. **Backend Updates**
   - Modified `cold-storage.service.ts` to search for temperature data using multiple field variants:
     - `name` (primary field as seen in the MongoDB screenshot)
     - `coldStorageName` (legacy field)
     - `coldstoragename` (alternative format)
   - Added case-insensitive matching for all field variants
   - Added sorting by `date` and `time` fields with fallback to `timestamp`

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Updated `DashboardColdStorage.tsx` to display data using the fields from the MongoDB collection:
     - Temperature, humidity
     - Date, time
     - Latitude, longitude
     - Device name
   - Added a debug panel that shows when username doesn't match records
   - Enhanced error handling for when the user's name doesn't match the `name` field in MongoDB

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Login and Name Extraction
Login as a cold storage user (e.g., username: "cold", password: "password"). The system will extract your username from the JWT token and store it in localStorage.

### 2. Check Local Storage
After login, open the cold storage dashboard. You should see:
- A localStorage value for `userName` (should be "cold")
- If no userName is found, the debug panel will appear

### 3. Manual Testing with Debug Panel
If the dashboard doesn't automatically display temperature data:
1. Use the debug panel to manually enter the name "cold" (as seen in the MongoDB screenshot)
2. Click "Fetch Temperature Data"
3. Temperature data should appear showing:
   - Temperature: 26.800002°C
   - Humidity: 62.4%
   - Date: 2025-10-08
   - Time: 04:41:23
   - Location: Latitude 20°, Longitude 38°
   - Device: esp1

### 4. Verify Order Table Display
After fetching temperature data successfully:
1. Check the order table which should now display:
   - Temperature and humidity in the "Temperature Details" column
   - Device name (e.g., "esp1") in the "Device" column
   - Coordinates (Lat: 20°, Long: 38°) in the "Location" column
   - The cold storage name in the appropriate column

If there are multiple orders in the table, each should display the temperature data associated with the cold storage facility handling that order.

### 4. API Testing

You can directly test the API with this curl command:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/cold-storage/temperature/storage/cold" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Replace YOUR_JWT_TOKEN with a valid JWT token from localStorage.

## Troubleshooting

If temperature data still doesn't appear:

1. Run the script to examine MongoDB data structure:
```bash
node debug_temp_data_fields.js
```

2. Run the script to add necessary indexes and check collection structure:
```bash
node add_coldStorage_index.js
```

3. Generate test temperature data if needed:
```bash
node generate_test_temp_data.js
```

4. Check the backend logs for any API errors
5. Check the browser console for frontend errors
