# Logistics Dashboard Status Variations Fix

## Issue
Orders with status "dispatched to logistics" (with spaces) were not showing as assignable in the logistics dashboard. Only orders with status "shippedtologistics" (no spaces) were being recognized.

## Root Cause
The system was checking for an exact match of 'shippedtologistics' but orders could have various status formats:
- `shippedtologistics` (no spaces)
- `shipped to logistics` (with spaces)
- `dispatched to logistics` (alternative wording)
- Various case variations

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - DashboardLogistics.tsx

#### Updated `isOrderAssignable` function (Lines 449-467)
**Changed from:**
- Only checked for exact match: `normalizedStatus === 'shippedtologistics'`

**Changed to:**
- Removes all spaces from status: `status.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')`
- Checks multiple valid statuses: `['shippedtologistics', 'shippedtologistics', 'dispatchedtologistics']`

```typescript
const isOrderAssignable = (order: any) => {
  if (!order || !order.status) return false;
  
  const normalizedStatus = order.status.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '');
  const validStatuses = ['shippedtologistics', 'shippedtologistics', 'dispatchedtologistics'];
  
  return validStatuses.includes(normalizedStatus);
};
```

#### Updated Order Status Chip Display (Lines 749-783)
- Now displays "READY FOR PICKUP" for all status variations
- Handles case-insensitive matching
- Removes spaces for comparison

**Chip Label Logic:**
```typescript
const statusNormalized = statusLower.replace(/\s+/g, '');

if (statusNormalized === 'shippedtologistics' || 
    statusNormalized === 'dispatchedtologistics' ||
    statusLower === 'dispatched to logistics') {
  return 'READY FOR PICKUP';
}
```

### 2. Backend - logistics.service.ts

#### Updated `getAvailableOrders` function (Lines 199-217)
**Changed from:**
- Single regex: `{ status: { $regex: /^shippedtologistics$/i } }`

**Changed to:**
- Multiple regex patterns to catch all variations:
```typescript
$or: [
  { status: { $regex: /^shipped\s*to\s*logistics$/i } },
  { status: { $regex: /^dispatched\s*to\s*logistics$/i } },
  { status: { $regex: /^shippedtologistics$/i } }
]
```

This handles:
- `shippedtologistics` (no spaces)
- `shipped to logistics` (with spaces)
- `dispatched to logistics` (alternative wording)
- Any case variation (uppercase, lowercase, mixed)

#### Updated `assignOrderToVehicle` function (Lines 118-127)
**Changed from:**
- Exact match check: `order.status !== 'shippedtologistics'`

**Changed to:**
- Normalized status check with multiple valid values:
```typescript
const statusLower = order.status?.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '') || '';
const validStatuses = ['shippedtologistics', 'dispatchedtologistics'];

if (!validStatuses.includes(statusLower)) {
  throw new BadRequestException(...);
}
```

### 3. Compiled Backend - logistics.service.js

Applied all the same changes to the compiled JavaScript files:
- Updated `getAvailableOrders` (Lines 173-188)
- Updated `assignOrderToVehicle` (Lines 111-119)

## Supported Status Variations

The system now accepts orders with any of these status formats:

### Exact Matches (case-insensitive):
- `shippedtologistics`
- `ShippedToLogistics`
- `SHIPPEDTOLOGISTICS`
- `shipped to logistics`
- `Shipped To Logistics`
- `SHIPPED TO LOGISTICS`
- `dispatched to logistics`
- `Dispatched To Logistics`
- `DISPATCHED TO LOGISTICS`
- `dispatchedtologistics`

### After Normalization (spaces removed, lowercase):
All above variations normalize to one of:
- `shippedtologistics`
- `dispatchedtologistics`

## Testing Steps

1. Restart both backend and frontend servers

2. Create/Find an order with status variations:
   - "dispatched to logistics"
   - "shipped to logistics"
   - "shippedtologistics"

3. Login as logistics user

4. Verify order appears in logistics dashboard

5. Verify order shows as "READY FOR PICKUP" with warning (orange) color

6. Verify order can be selected with checkbox

7. Assign order to a vehicle

8. Verify assignment succeeds

## Expected Behavior

✅ All status variations are recognized as assignable
✅ Orders display as "READY FOR PICKUP" 
✅ Orders can be assigned to vehicles
✅ Bulk assignment works with all status variations
✅ Console logs show proper status recognition
✅ Backend validates and accepts all variations
