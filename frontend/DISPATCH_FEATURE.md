# Order Dispatch to Logistics Feature

## Overview
Implemented a feature for sellers to dispatch ordered products to logistics providers from their dashboard.

## Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Order History Table (`src/components/OrderHistoryTable.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- **Dispatch Button**: Added "Dispatch to Logistics" button for orders with "pending" status
- **Logistics Selection Dialog**: Modal dialog to select from available logistics providers
- **Provider Details Display**: Shows company name, email, phone, and address of selected provider
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes order list after successful dispatch

**New State Management:**
- `logisticsProviders`: List of available logistics providers
- `dispatchDialog`: Controls dispatch modal visibility
- `selectedLogisticsId`: Tracks selected logistics provider

**New API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /user/logistics-providers`: Fetches available logistics providers
- `POST /order/dispatch-to-logistics`: Dispatches order to selected logistics provider

### 2. Enhanced Seller Dashboard (`src/pages/DashboardSeller.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- **Pending Orders Counter**: Shows count of orders awaiting dispatch
- **Warning Banner**: Displays prominent notification when orders need dispatch
- **Real-time Updates**: Counter updates automatically when orders are dispatched

**New State Management:**
- `pendingOrdersCount`: Tracks number of pending orders

### 3. User Interface Improvements

**Order Actions:**
- Primary "Dispatch to Logistics" button for pending orders
- Secondary "Cancel" button for pending orders
- Existing "Report" functionality preserved

**Logistics Selection:**
- Clean, card-based provider selection
- Provider information display with company details
- Address information for delivery planning
- Form validation to ensure provider selection

**Visual Feedback:**
- Success/error messages for dispatch operations
- Loading states and disabled buttons during operations
- Color-coded order status chips

## Workflow

1. **Buyer Places Order**: Order appears with "pending" status in seller's order history
2. **Seller Dashboard**: Shows warning banner with count of pending orders
3. **Dispatch Process**:
   - Seller clicks "Dispatch to Logistics" button
   - Modal opens with list of available logistics providers
   - Seller selects provider and views their details
   - Seller confirms dispatch
4. **Post-Dispatch**: Order status updates, pending count decreases

## API Integration

### Expected Backend Endpoints:

```typescript
// Get logistics providers
GET /user/logistics-providers
Response: LogisticsProvider[]

interface LogisticsProvider {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  address: string;
  phone?: string;
  companyName?: string;
}

// Dispatch order to logistics
POST /order/dispatch-to-logistics
Body: {
  orderId: string;
  logisticsId: string;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Tracking Integration**: Add tracking number generation
2. **Delivery Estimates**: Show estimated delivery times
3. **Bulk Dispatch**: Allow dispatching multiple orders at once
4. **Logistics Filtering**: Filter providers by location, capacity, etc.
5. **Cost Integration**: Display shipping costs for different providers
6. **Notifications**: Real-time notifications to logistics providers
